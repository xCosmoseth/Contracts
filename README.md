This repository contains contracts that I'm coding, whether for fun or otherwise.

**Experimentations Folder**

In this section, I will share experimental contracts that cater to specific use cases.

- **FundMyNFTWithAuth.sol**: This contract was designed for individuals who wish to publicly raise funds to purchase an NFT. The authorized addresses should belong to individuals recognized as trustworthy within the space. For instance, if you intend to gather donations for buying a particular NFT, you could designate the project's team members as authorizers. They would then possess the authority to allow you to access the funds for your NFT purchase. Naturally, you retain control over the funds once approved for withdrawal, but since this is a public action, your reputation could be impacted in case of any misuse ;)
